Within large software projects, automated tools can be used to identify and remove dead code. Dependency and package managers allow to install only the components needed for the operations of service software, some have the ability to prune unused software out of the codebase once an option is disabled or a package removed. Third-party software providers possibly give options to what is included in the packaging, compilation or installation of their software.  \\nCode minimization is assessed in terms of whether the selected method actually helps in minimizing code, to which extend, and whether the code minimization effort is proportionate to the reduction of the security risk. In assessing this latter dimension the introduction of ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] can be referred to.'),\n",
