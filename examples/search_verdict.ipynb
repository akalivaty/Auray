It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

       " {'page_content': '5.7.1.0 Test group objective The test group addresses the provision 5.7-1. This test group assesses whether the verification mechanism is suitable to verify the software based on the provided security guarantees and provides evidence about their implementation. To enable tamper resistance, at least integrity and authenticity are necessary secure guarantees in context of this test group.  \\nNOTE: Threat modelling and the baseline attacker model described in clauses D.1 and D.2 are helpful to derive appropriate security guarantees, conceptually evaluate the corresponding mechanisms and functionally evaluate the correct implementation on a basic level.  \\nThe purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the secure boot mechanisms of the DUT.  \\nTest units b) The TL **shall** assess whether for each secure boot mechanism in IXIT 20-SecBoot the \"Description\" and corresponding \"Detection Mechanisms\" are suitable to provide the \"Security Guarantees\" it is used.  \\na) The TL **shall** assess whether the \"Security Guarantees\" of each secure boot mechanism in IXIT 20-SecBoot provide at least verification of integrity and authenticity of device software.  \\nThe verdict PASS is assigned if:  \\n- every secure boot mechanism provides the security guarantees of integrity and authenticity of the device software; and\\n- every secure boot mechanism and its detection mechanisms is suitable to provide the described security guarantee.  \\nThe verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.  \\n5.7.1.2 Test case 5.7-1-2 (functional)  \\nThe purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of the secure boot mechanisms of the DUT.  \\nTest units a) The TL **shall** functionally assess whether the verification of the device software is implemented according to the information in IXIT 20-SecBoot.  \\nNOTE: Such inspection can include the simple manipulation of the firmware (e.g. bit manipulation), if the TL can get access to the firmware with basic resources (compare to clause D.2).  \\nThe verdict PASS is assigned if:  \\n- there is no indication, that the implementation of any secure boot mechanism differs from its IXIT\\ndocumentation.  \\nThe verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.',\n",
